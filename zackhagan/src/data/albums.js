    blurb: `This is a series of recordings made between Brooklyn and Denver over 7 years.
All instruments and vocals are Zack Hagan. This album represents an intensely personal look
at life, love, and loss. While immensly dense at points it's also incredibly sparse in others
all created with a blend of home made synths and guitars.`,

    blurb: `
    Dark Xmas, the new album of audio artistry from EDM artist and producer ZACK HAGAN, was recorded in Brooklyn, NY and Nashville, TN. 3 of the 6 original songs are a result of remote collaborations between Hagan & his lifelong friend and musical compatriot, acclaimed Nashville-based banjoist Charles Butler. Butler appears on the tracks 'tao of 3 systems', 'The 7th Ring', and 'animal waiting'. These pieces began as a chance internet sharing between the two composers. Elemetary school friends growing up in Ohio, the two parted ways in the 1990s when Charles' family moved to far away Burlington, Vermont, home of the the iconic jamband Phish. Shortly after Charles' family moved from Ohio, Zack's family also moved, to Chicago, Illinois, home of house music, where Zack began his lifelong obsession with electronica. Now after decades of perfecting each of their own unique and inspiring musical voices, they're back together delivering an ever increasing variety of electronic dance music and improvisation, with a twist of Americana.

    title: 'Muramba Sessions',

    img: 'link to image',
    blurb: 'The Muramba Sessions is a distinctive electronic music project by Denver-based singer-songwriter and producer Zack Hagan, originally released in 2008 on Roc-elle Records. The album was inspired by immersive field recordings Hagan made during a trip to Rwanda in 2007, blending hypnotic electronic textures with world-influenced motifs that reflect the emotional and environmental landscape of his experiences there. The seven-track set—including titles like Unity and Reconciliation, Lake Kivu, and Kigali—serves as both a sonic journey through place and memory and a bridge between Hagan’s acoustic roots and experimental electronic production. It showcases his multifaceted talents as a musician, composer, and engineer, demonstrating a compelling fusion of rhythm, atmosphere, and cultural resonance.',

    img: 'link to image',
    blurb: `This record is made from edits of a porno movie soundtrack I did for Porno Jim's "Hookin' Up".
    A treasure of film to be sure, full of softcore hipters performing hardcore acts. I guess looking back on it, I was blessed
    to be asked to make a soundtrack. At the time, this was a representation some unreleased works and other newly created longform
    jams. Porno Jim insisted that the scenes always have music which means I was making, like 30 minute edits of songs.
    Which is pretty long even for the Gratful Dead. After editing it down, Rhapsody @ Trash Mansion was born.
    Trash Mansion is an actual place in DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, for the unintiated) Brooklyn.
    This is where the movie was filmed and I spent countless hours there between two friend's lofts. Apartments 502 and 208.`,

    blurb: 'Zack Hagan is the self-titled debut album from Zack Hagan, originally released in 2007 on Roc-elle Records. The record presents a rich tapestry of songs that highlight Hagan’s wide-ranging musical sensibilities — from intimate, narrative-driven lyrics to immersive, melody-rich arrangements. Across its 11 tracks, including songs like Hudson, Tattered Tea Time Girl, and Barely a Sound, the album bridges indie rock, electronic textures, and folk-inflected songwriting in a cohesive and compelling whole. Hagan wrote, produced, and arranged all of the music himself, performing vocals and a variety of instruments such as guitar, bass, accordion, and synthesizers, underscoring his multifaceted artistry.',
